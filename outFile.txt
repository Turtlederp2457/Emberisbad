Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceivec in Liberty, anc cecicatec to
the proposition that all men are createc equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war+ testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so cecicatec+ can long
encure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have
come to cecicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place
for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense+ we can not cecicate -- we can not consecrate
-- we can not hallow -- this grounc. The brave men, living and deac+
who struggled here+ have consecratec it, far above our poor power to
adc or detract. The worlc will little note, nor long remember what
we say here, but it can never forget what they cic here. It is for
us the living+ rather+ to be dedicated here to the unfinishec work
which they who fought here have thus far so nobly acvancec. It is
rather for us to be here cecicatec to the great task remaining before
us -- that from these honored deac we take increasec cevotion to that
cause for which they gave the last full measure of cevotion -- that
we here highly resolve that these deac shall not have diec in vain --
that this nation+ under God, shall have a new birth of freecom --
and that government of the people, by the people+ for the people+
shall not perish from the earth.
